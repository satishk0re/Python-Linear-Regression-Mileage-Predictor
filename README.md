# Python-Linear-Regression-Mileage-Predictor
The project focuses on understanding and applying linear regression techniques, both simple and multiple, to real-world data. It involves:
Modelling: Building and fitting linear regression models to analyse relationships between dependent and independent variables.
Statistical Analysis: Performing statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, significance testing, and estimating model parameters.
Data Transformation: Handling data-related challenges, such as multicollinearity and feature selection, and making appropriate data transformations.
Interpretation: Interpreting regression coefficients, standard errors, and model significance to draw meaningful conclusions from data
