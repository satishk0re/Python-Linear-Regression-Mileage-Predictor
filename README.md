Multiple Linear Regression Analysis for Transportation Data

This project employs multiple linear regression to analyze transportation-related datasets. The first part focuses on Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, examining the relationship between various vehicle attributes and miles per gallon (mpg). The second part delves into traffic speed prediction using flow, occupancy, speed_down, and flow_ratio as predictors.

Key Features:

Part 1: OLS Regression

Utilizes statsmodels and pandas for regression analysis.
Examines the impact of vehicle attributes on fuel efficiency (mpg).
Part 2: Traffic Speed Prediction

Implements linear regression for speed prediction based on traffic parameters.
Evaluates models using metrics such as RMSE and R^2.
Explores Ridge and Lasso Regression for enhanced model performance.
Dependencies:

pandas
statsmodels
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn
Usage:

Load the transportation dataset.
Run OLS regression for fuel efficiency analysis.
Predict traffic speed using various traffic parameters and evaluate models.
Feel free to explore, contribute, and enhance the predictive capabilities of the models!
